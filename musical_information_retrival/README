A musical infromation retrival program. provides gettting information about songs
in the system
Design :
	My code consists a base class of songs which called Song. this base class is match to a type of 
	an abstract song which defines some attributes that fits to all kind of songs in this ex.
	There are two derives classes that inheritance from Song.
	the first is InstrumentalSong which is a song that has no lyrics and the second is Lyrical song
	which is a song who has lyrics.
	I decided to implement it that way because Song is a general father type and has attributes
	that any song has such as title or tags match score, but for every type of song given in the ex
	there are some uniques attributes such as instruments match score or lyrics.
	Beside of those I have namespace Parser which functions as a static class deals only with 
	parsing the three given files.
	Parameters class is a class that having all the given parameters as given in the parameters 
	file. it has setters and getters for every parameter in it which are saved as private for
	encapsulation.
	Finally MIR.cpp is the driver for the program. implementing the sort as given in SortHelper
	and prints the results per query.
